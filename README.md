                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Business Communication and Ethics (CSL505) is a core subject in the Third Year (Semester V) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. This course focuses on developing essential professional skills, including effective communication, ethical decision-making, and corporate etiquette required for the modern workplace.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in Business Communication and Ethics:

- **Communication Theory**: Verbal and non-verbal communication, barriers to communication.
- **Business Writing**: Reports, proposals, emails, and statement of purpose (SOP).
- **Interpersonal Skills**: Group discussions, interviews, and presentation skills.
- **Professional Ethics**: Corporate social responsibility, code of conduct, and ethical dilemmas.
- **Technical Writing**: Documentation standards and project report writing.
- **Team Dynamics**: Leadership, conflict resolution, and collaborative working.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, assignments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As a computer engineer, soft skills and ethical grounding are as critical as technical prowess. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for reviewing communication strategies and ethical guidelines.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental soft skills.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through BCE.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.
